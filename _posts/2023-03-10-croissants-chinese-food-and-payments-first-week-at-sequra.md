The morning of February 27th was a day of new beginnings for me as I stepped into the imponent and bustling office of SeQura, a big fintech company in Barcelona. I was nervous and excited to start my new role as a Software Engineer, but I was soon put at ease by the warm welcome from the People team.

As I walked into the meeting room, I was greeted with the sweet aroma of freshly baked croissants and smiling faces of my fellow newcomers. It was comforting to know that I wasn't the only newbie in the building, and a colleague from the People Team was there to guide us through the onboarding process.

We spent the morning learning about the company's culture, values, and how it is organized. It was a lot of information to take in (and in Spanish!!!), but I was impressed by how much SeQura invests in its employees' growth and development.

At lunchtime, I had the opportunity to bond with some "veteran" colleagues who welcomed me to the Tech Team with open arms. We went to a nearby Chinese restaurant, and it was nice to see how they genuinely cared about my transition to the company.

The rest of the week was a whirlwind of introductions, tech setup, and team bonding activities. I was assigned to the Payments Circle, which is part of the Tech Team, and began interacting with my new colleagues, learning about their backgrounds, the products we own, and how our roles will collaborate to make a positive impact for SeQura's customers.

On Thursday I attended to my first All Hands and I was impressed by how much the company values its employees' opinions and encourages them to contribute to the company's success. I had to introduce myself to the audience who was at the event in person and whoever was watching it online.

Overall, I'm thrilled to have joined SeQura, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me here. It's a great feeling to work with people who are kind, supportive, and passionate about what they do.

If you're considering a change in your career, I highly recommend checking out SeQura. Who knows, maybe you'll be the next one enjoying croissants on your first day!
