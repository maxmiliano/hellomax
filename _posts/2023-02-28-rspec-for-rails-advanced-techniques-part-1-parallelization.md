excerpt: "Writing tests is an important part of the development process. But, as your application grows, the test suite can become slower and slower, causing frustration and wasting valuable time. One way to speed up your tests is by running them in parallel. In this article, we'll dive into how to improve your test performance through test parallelization. This is the first article of a three-part series, where we will discuss different strategies for efficient RSpec testing in Rails."

## What is Test Parallelization
Test parallelization is the process of running tests simultaneously on multiple threads or processes, instead of one after the other. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to run a full test suite. By parallelizing your tests, you can also catch issues faster, allowing you to focus on writing new features.

## Implementing Test Parallelization with RSpec
RSpec provides a number of ways to run tests in parallel. One of the easiest ways to get started with test parallelization is by using the `parallel_tests` gem. The `parallel_tests` provides a rake task that splits your test suite into multiple processes, allowing you to take advantage of multi-core CPUs.

Here's how to install and use `parallel_tests`:
1. Add `parallel_tests` gem to your Gemfile:
    ~~~ruby
    group :test do
      gem 'parallel-tests'
    end
    ~~~

1. Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

1. Update your `config/database.yml` to consider the number of the test the database name.
    ~~~yml
    test:
      database: application_test<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %> 
    ~~~
    Change `application` to your project name or any other name you use for your database. `ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER']` will be the number of the instance being tested. For now we'll just consider that the `parallel_tests` gem will handle this instances for us.

1. Create additional databases by running the `rake parallel:create` task. 
    ~~~sh
    rake parallel:create
    ~~~

1. Run your tests in parallel using `rake parallel:spec` task.
    ~~~sh
    rake parallel:spec
    ~~~

It's that simple! `parallel_tests` will automatically split your test suite into multiple processes, allowing you to take advantage of multi-core CPUs.

You may want check the `parallel_tests` [GitHub page](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests){:target="_blank"} to get more insights and learn more advanced settings and tasks to run. In this article we went only though the basics concepts.

## Conclusion
In this article, we discussed how to improve your test performance through test parallelization in Rails using the `parallel_tests` gem. By running your tests in parallel, you can reduce the time it takes to run a full test suite, catch issues faster, and focus on writing new features.

Stay tuned for the next article in this series, where we will discuss how to leverage shared examples and context for DRY tests.
