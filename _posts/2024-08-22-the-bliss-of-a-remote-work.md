This past Saturday, I traded the bustling streets of Barcelona for the tranquil beauty of Llançà, a charming coastal town in Girona, Catalunya. With just a train ride away, I found myself at a cozy house near the beach, ready to blend work with the serenity of the sea.

For three days, Monday through Wednesday, I’ve been doing my usual work as a Backend Software Engineer. My tasks haven’t changed: coding, attending meetings, reviewing pull requests and collaborating with my team. The difference? My workspace now comes with a stunning view of the beach, where the waves gently kiss the shore and the horizon stretches far beyond the confines of my computer screen, until it meets a village and a mountain on the other side.

As I sit here, with the sound of the sea as my background music and the fresh ocean breeze filtering through the open _terraza_ door, I can’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude. The ability to work remotely allows me to bring my job to inspiring places like Llançà, where each glance away from my screen is a reminder of the beauty of life beyond the digital world.

Working in this environment has a way of refreshing the mind and fueling creativity. The usual rhythm of work—code reviews, meetings, and project updates—flows effortlessly here. There’s something about seeing the vastness of the ocean that makes the challenges of the day seem a little smaller, a little more manageable.

And for today I'm shifting gears completely. As starting this Thursday I’ll be taking two days off to fully immerse myself in everything this beautiful town has to offer. Long walks on the beach, exploring the hidden gems and simply unwinding away from the keyboard.

By Saturday, I’ll be back on the train to Barcelona, returning to the familiar rhythm of city life and work at Qonto’s office on Calle Pau Claris. But for now, I’m savoring every moment of this experience. Proof that with remote work you can have the best of both worlds: productivity and a little slice of paradise.
