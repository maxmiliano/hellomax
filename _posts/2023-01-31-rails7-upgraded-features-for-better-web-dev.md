Rails 7 is here for a while now, since December 2021, and it brings some awesome new features to the table. If you're a Rails developer, and haven't upgraded to 7 yet, you might be missing some cool stuff. Here are a few things you might want to take a closer look at.

One of the biggest changes in Rails 7 is support for multiple databases. This means that you can easily connect your application to multiple databases and switch between them with ease. This is a huge deal for apps that handle a ton of data or need to be highly scalable. No more manually handling connections, it's all built-in now!

Another cool new feature is parallel testing. This allows you to run tests at the same time, which can save you a ton of time. No more waiting for test results, you can get back to coding and creating in no time.

Rails 7 also includes support for Action Text, making it easy to add rich text editing capabilities to your app. Plus, it has improved performance and security features to make your app run smoother and safer.

All in all, Rails 7 is a solid upgrade. It brings a lot of new features that can help you create better and more efficient apps. So go ahead, give Rails 7 a try and see for yourself just how awesome it is.

**Rails 7.1 is comming!** By the time this article was written the most recent stable Rails version is 7.0.4.2 (released on January 25, 2023). But there is already a Release Candidate for Rails 7.1 available. Which means an official 7.1 may be released soon with many changes. I'll write about these when time comes, so if you want to be the first to read about it be sure to [subscribe to our blog newsletter](http://eepurl.com/igx0pj){:target="_blank"}.
