As a Software Engineer for SeQura, a leading FinTech based in sunny Barcelona, Spain, we are frequently faced with exciting new challenges and opportunities. Recently, one such opportunity came knocking at my team's door. A new project was on the horizon: building an integration application, a tool designed to facilitate communication between our suite of apps and a third-party application from a payment partner.

The first step of this thrilling journey? A familiar command: `rails new [app]`.

The echoes of the past hit me as I entered those words into the terminal, transporting me back nearly 15 years. Back to when I was an eager new developer, my fingers poised for the first time over the keys, about to type `rails new...` in dakr prompt with a blinking white cursor. Even now, after so many years and countless projects, the simple act of starting a new Rails app never loses its charm.

Believe it or not, one of the earliest and most unexpectedly challenging parts of this journey wasn't about code at all. It was about naming our new baby. We initially created our Rails app with a placeholder name. But everyone in the team already knew that we needed a more fitting name quickly - one that encapsulates the purpose and spirit of the application.

This name needed to be meaningful yet straightforward, and also should be able to embrace future partnerships, and it had to keep a striking a balance between complexity and simplicity. It should resonate not only with our own team but also with other team members from diverse areas within the company. Thus, after a flood of brainstorming sessions, intense debates, talking to other gurus inside the company and a fair share of creative sparks, we finally landed on the perfect name: "Partner Integration Middleware". It was like finding a missing puzzle piece that just clicked into place.

Now, as I embark on the journey of bringing "Partner Integration Middleware" to life, the anticipation is palpable. I know that we still have some more steps ahead. Every new project comes with its own set of unique challenges, yet it also brings an incomparable sense of joy and fulfillment. It's like being handed a massive multiclored diverse box of Lego blocks â€“ each piece unique and crucial in its own right. Our job? To assemble these blocks into something amazing.

I stand at the threshold of this exciting new adventure, eager to explore, learn and grow. The simple act of crafting a new Rails app, of turning an abstract idea into a tangible, functioning application, is a kind of magic that never gets old.

To all you avid readers, thank you for being part of this journey with me so far. Your support and engagement are what fuel this adventure. Let's continue learning, growing, and exploring this world of software engineering together.
