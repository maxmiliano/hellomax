## Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system that is used to manage the source code for a software project. It allows you to track changes to your code, revert back to previous versions, and collaborate with other developers.

GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on software projects. It provides version control for your code, allowing you to track changes and work with other developers on the same project.

Git and GitHub are essential tools for any software developer, and are widely used in the industry. In this article, we'll go over the basics of getting started with GitHub and creating a repository for a Ruby on Rails (RoR) app.

## Steps to create a repository for a Ruby on Rails App
1. First, make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, go to [https://github.com](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} and sign up for a free account.

1. Next, install Git on your computer. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers. You can download Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"}.

1. Once Git is installed, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to store your RoR project.

1. Initialize a Git repository in the project directory of your Rails app by running the following command:
~~~sh
git init
~~~ 

1. Next, create a new repository on GitHub by going to your dashboard and clicking the "New" button. Give your repository a name and a description, and select "Private" or "Public" depending on your preference.

1. Once you've created the repository, you'll see a page with instructions on how to connect your local repository to the one you just created on GitHub. Follow the instructions to add a remote for your repository on GitHub.

1. Now you can start working on your RoR app. As you make changes to your code, you can use Git to track those changes. To do this, you'll need to "commit" your changes to the repository. To make a commit, run the following commands:
~~~sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message goes here"
~~~
The "git add" command adds all of your changes to a staging area, and the "git commit" command saves those changes to your local repository. It's a good practice to add meaninfull messages when you commit your files to a repository.

1. Once you've made some commits, you can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub by running the following command:
~~~sh
git push origin main
~~~
This will push all of your local commits to the "main" branch of the repository on GitHub. You may be asked to enter your GitHub credentials at this moment.


That's it! You should now have a functioning repository for your RoR app on GitHub. You can use Git to track changes to your code, collaborate with other developers, and deploy your app to production.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
