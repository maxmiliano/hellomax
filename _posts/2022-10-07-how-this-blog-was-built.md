This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages and it was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) following a [tutorial](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) from [GitHub Skills](https://github.com/skills). Jekyll is a static site generator that was made to be easy to use by developers. If you also want quickly build a programming blog or a portfolio site to showcase your projects I would definetely recoment it for you.

The layout and style is mostly based on [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) with just a little tweaks and changes.

I plan to start posting regularly about my favorite programming language (wich is Ruby by the way), algorithms, coding challenges and Software Engineering topics.
