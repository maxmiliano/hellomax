## What is RSpec?
RSpec is a popular testing framework for Ruby on Rails applications. It provides a simple, readable syntax for writing tests, making it easy to write expressive and accurate tests for your application. In this article, we will discuss the basics of RSpec and show you how to add the RSpec gem to your Rails application. By the end of this article, you will have a solid understanding of how to use RSpec to test your Rails application, and you'll be able to write your own tests for your application.

First, let's start by discussing the basics of RSpec. RSpec is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework, which means that it focuses on the behavior of the application rather than its implementation. This approach makes it easier to write tests that accurately reflect the behavior of your application and can help you to catch any bugs or inconsistencies early on in the development process.

RSpec tests are made up of three main components: `describe`, `context`, and `it` blocks.
- `describe` blocks are used to group together related tests; 
- `context` blocks are used to provide additional context for tests;
- `it` blocks are used to define individual tests.

Here's an example of a simple RSpec tests that assure if a variable is equal to a certain values:
~~~ruby
describe "example test" do
  context "when the variable is equal to 5" do
    it "checks if the variable is equal to 5" do
      variable = 5
      expect(variable).to eq(5)
    end
  end
  
  context "when the variable is not equal to 5" do
    it "checks if the variable is not equal to 5" do
      variable = 6
      expect(variable).not_to eq(5)
    end
  end
end
~~~
In this example, we have a `describe` block with the title "example test". Inside of that we have two `context` block that are used to provide additional context for the tests, one is when the variable is equal to 5 and the other one is when the variable is not equal to 5. 

Inside of each context block, we have an `it` block that are used to define individual tests. The first `it` block checks if the variable is equal to 5, and the second one checks if the variable is not equal to 5.

The `expect(variable).to eq(5)` is checking if variable is equal to 5, and the `expect(variable).not_to eq(5)` is checking if variable is not equal to 5.

## Installing the RSpec gem
Now, let's move on to adding RSpec to your Rails application. 

To add RSpec to your Rails application, you will need to add the `rspec-rails` gem to your Gemfile. It's a good practice to add this only for development and test environment.
~~~ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 6.0.0'
end
~~~

Then you need to run the following bundle command to install the gem:
~~~sh
bundle install
~~~

After that, you'll be able to run the a generator command to bootstrap RSpec into your app:
~~~sh
rails generate rspec:install
~~~

And finally, you'll be able to run tests by typing this command:
~~~
bundle exec rspec
~~~

Congratulations! You have RSpec ready to use in your Rails application.

## Conclusion
RSpec is a powerful testing framework for Ruby on Rails applications. It provides a simple, readable syntax for writing tests, making it easy to write expressive and accurate tests for your application. By adding the RSpec gem to your Rails application and following the steps outlined in this article, you can start using RSpec to test your application.

Now that you have RSpec set up and running, you can start writing tests for your application. In the next article, we will dive into how to write tests for our travel app, showing you how RSpec tests work and how to use them to catch bugs and inconsistencies early on in the development process. 

It's important to keep in mind that testing is a crucial step in the development process, and using RSpec can help you to ensure that your application is working as expected before deploying it to production.

I hope this guide has helped you understand the basics of RSpec and how to add the RSpec gem to your Rails project.
